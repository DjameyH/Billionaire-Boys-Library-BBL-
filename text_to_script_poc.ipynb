    "# Text To Script Proof Of Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk through the implementation, of a creative AI tool which helps writers turn text into workable scripts instantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be split up into 3 parts:\n",
    "1. Input sentence splitting: The input text will be split into sentences in order for a emotion classifier to be able to tag every sentence seperately.\n",
    "2. Sentence emotion tagging: The split sentences will be tagged with an emotion and a confidence score.\n",
    "3. Combining resulting sentences as an input for a LLM: The resulting tagged sentences will be combined together again in order to be used as an input to a LLM\n",
    "4. Generating a script using a LLM: The LLM will be prompted to write a script based on the input text which now has emotion tags after every sentence in order to better capture the emotion in a line for the actors to use.\n",
